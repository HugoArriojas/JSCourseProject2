#Alphabetized Alcohols

Alphabetized Alcohols is one of my first forays into Javascript.

The app functions as follows:
The user can input a letter (or have a random one chosen for them) and then they will receive a list of alcohols that start with that letter along with the ingredients required to make said drink.

This app needs some serious work in order to make it more responsive on smaller screens, and other integrations.
The API used is courtesy of TheCocktailDb found here: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/

This app is very much unfinished, so if you want to check out some of my more completed programs, please check them out at https://www.hugoa.dev/

Thank you for checking out my repo!
